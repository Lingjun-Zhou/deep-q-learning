# Deep Q-Learning

## Overview

Our version of the deep q-learning algorithm from [The DQN
paper](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf). This algorithm reads
the screen and the integer score of the Atari 2600 game Space Invaders. The
output is the same control commands as a human would have with a controller
(albeit, without the physical controller).

## Installation Dependencies:
* Python 2.7
* Theano
* Lasagne
* pygame
* [Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)](arcadelearningenvironment.org)
